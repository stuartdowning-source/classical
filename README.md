# Classical Computing
Each weeks work understanding code will be posted here.

Your assignment each week will be to take the diffrent coding language posted above and read through it, and by intuition and what you already know you can write notes on what you think it does, each week in class we'll discuss the piece of code and what it does, be prepared to start the conversation by looking at your notes and asking a question about something in the code that you didn't understand or wanted to know the meaning behind.
